Running the barcode analysis script with the test data (UMGC-423-variable_S64_L001_R1_001.fastq) and appropriate reference file (Supplemental_File_8.fasta in REcount/Supplemental_Files folder) using the command below should produce the output in the REcount/REcount_test_data/Expected_output folder.

$REcount_barcode_analysis.py -i <UMGC-423-variable_S64_L001_R1_001.fastq> -r <Supplemental_File_8.fasta> -m 1
